				<h1 id="about-this-site">About this site</h1>
				
				<p>This website was created to publicly record how many out LGBT ministers are appointed as part of the UK Government.</p>
				
				<p>The data collected shows ministerial appointees who are 'out' as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or with another minority sexual orientation or gender identity, and for which I can find a reliable source.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Select a minister's name to see their ministerial portfolio, constituency and the sources of the information.</strong></p>
				
				<h1 id="structured-data">Structured data</h1>
				
				<p>This dataset is available as a <a href="https://github.com/johnpeart/lgbt-ministers/tree/master/_data" tabindex="0">CSV file on Github</a>.</p>
				
				<!--p>The file contains historical data, starting with the 2015 to 2017 Parliament.</p-->
				
				<h1 id="sources">Sources</h1>
				
				<p>This information has been collated from internet searches and publicly available information. A minister is listed either when they have made a public statement about their sexual orientation or gender identity, or there is a reliable independent source.</p>
